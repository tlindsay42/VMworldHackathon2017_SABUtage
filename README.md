* VMworld US 2017 Hackathon
* Team SABUtage
* August 28, 2017

## Goal

* We are going to use PowerCLI to automate an end-to-end setup of a vSAN stretched cluster. Right now, there are a bunch of manual steps involved around HA, DRS, affinity groups, etc. The objective will be to have this automated (and learn something along the way).
